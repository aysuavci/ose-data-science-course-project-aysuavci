**Zimmermann, F. (2020).** [“The Dynamics of Motivated Beliefs.” *American Economic Journal: Microeconomics* 110 (2): 337–363.](https://doi.org/10.1257/aer.20180728)

In the literature on motivated reasoning, many studies argue that individuals may engage in belief manipulation in order to preserve a positive self-image, resulting in deviations from Bayesian belief predictions. Zimmermann's (2020) research intends to investigate motivated belief dynamics in the presence of feedback. The researcher conducted lab experiments with various treatment groups to explore the belief adjustments of the subjects depending on the feedback type obtained. Based on the experiment results, Zimmermann (2020) concluded that even though subjects adjust their beliefs in short run in line with feedback type; the effects of negative feedback tend to fade away over time, whereas positive feedback has a long-lasting effect on belief adjustment.

In order to establish the dynamic belief pattern, Zimmermann (2020) made use of difference-in-difference (DID) estimations which will be analyzed in detail through the project notebook. The replication is carried on the main notebook from this repository. Functions for tables, plots, regressions and variable definitions, can be found in the auxiliary folders. The replication can also be visualized using nbviewer and mybinder:

To ensure the reproducibility of the project, the repository is supported by a GitHub Actions Continuos Integration (CI). The state of my workflow can be found here:
